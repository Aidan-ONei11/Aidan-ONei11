# 👋 Hey, I’m Aidan O’Neill

### 🧑‍💻 Shopify Developer · E-Commerce Specialist   

I’m an e-commerce developer building on Shopify, working with brands that keep me busy enough to forget I’m still finishing their last three projects.
Shipping new features, setting up integrations, and fixing whatever breaks along the way.
